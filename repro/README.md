# Reproducible Delivery (Fig/Table)

This folder defines a clone-and-run reproducibility contract for the paper outputs.

## Entry Point

Run from repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/repro/reproduce_paper.sh
```

Optional variants:

```bash
# Also compile paper/main.tex (requires latexmk + RevTeX toolchain)
bash scripts/repro/reproduce_paper.sh --with-paper

# Package existing outputs only (skip generation)
bash scripts/repro/reproduce_paper.sh --package-only
```

## Output Layout

Each run is isolated under:

`repro/runs/<RUN_ID>/`

Generated contents:

- `logs/`: per-step execution logs.
- `steps.tsv`: step status and timing.
- `figures/`: normalized names `Fig_XX_*.png`.
- `tables/`: normalized names `Tab_XX_*.csv`.
- `paper/`: optional packaged `Paper_main.pdf`.
- `artifact_index.csv`: source -> artifact mapping with checksums.
- `checksums.sha256`: sha256 file for packaged artifacts.
- `manifest.json`: run metadata (timestamp, commit, missing/packaged counts).

`repro/latest` is a symlink to the most recent run directory.

## Naming Convention

- Figures: `Fig_<2-digit index>_<slug>.png`
- Tables: `Tab_<2-digit index>_<slug>.csv`
- Paper: `Paper_main.pdf` (optional)

The source-to-artifact mapping is versioned in `repro/artifact_map.csv`.

## Scope

This reproducibility layer targets paper-level deliverables (figures, table CSVs, optional PDF) and does not rename canonical raw outputs under `output/`.

## First-Principles Migration Artifacts

The one-click pipeline also packages the cross-module migration snapshot:

- `output/first_principles_migration/first_principles_migration_summary.csv`
- `output/first_principles_migration/first_principles_migration_summary.png`

These files are generated by `code/scan_first_principles_migration_summary.py` from:
- `output/gn_fp_impact/gn_profile_impact.csv`
- `output/chi_open_system/chi_open_system_sensitivity.csv`

Additional g_N migration artifacts:
- `output/gn_fp_impact/gn_nmax_convergence.csv` (from `code/scan_gn_nmax_convergence.py`)
- `output/gn_fp_impact/gn_cardy_vs_phase_space.png` + `.csv` (from `code/plot_gn_cardy_vs_phase_space.py`)

Additional surrogate-transfer audit artifact:
- `output/chi_fp_2d/surrogate_vs_action_points.csv` + `_summary.csv`
  (from `code/scan_surrogate_vs_action_points.py`)

Additional core-parameter robustness artifacts:
- `output/robustness/core_param_robustness_table.csv` + `_cases.csv`
  (from `code/scan_core_param_robustness.py`)
